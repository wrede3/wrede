### Research Interests

##

I study a variant of the capacitated facility location problem in which customers have individual preferences regarding the facilities and each customer has to be served at their most preferred open facility.
Together with Christina Büsing and [Timo Gersing](https://combi.rwth-aachen.de/en/team/timo-gersing), we study combinatorial structures. 
In a joint project with Christina Büsing and [Markus Leitner](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/markus-leitner/), we study preprocessing and valid inequalities to improve *Gurobi*'s performance when solving the problem.
Together with Christina Büsing and [Felix Engelhardt](https://combi.rwth-aachen.de/en/team/felix-engelhardt), we study a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm if each customer has a strict preference ordering of the facilities.
